# rogueing

A [[http://clojure.org/] [Clojure]] project which procedurally generates a
fully connected dungeon (like those used in many roguelike games).
It was build using the [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen] [Leiningen]]
default template, and relies on [[http://sjl.bitbucket.org/clojure-lanterna/][clojure-lanterna]] for the visual (ascii) output.

## Usage

The code at the bottom of core.clj is commented with instructions on running the
program.
